# BlockChainTestPlayer
Test player for implementing block chain technology

This testplayer is being designed to implement block chain technology, Where we store each user responses in blocks which in turn helps admin/organizations to keep track of every moves of the test taker or to avoid changes done to responses even after submitting the test. Hence this ensures two way security of the screeing process of an candidate.
